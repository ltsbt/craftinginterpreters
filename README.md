Lox implementation following the [craftinginterpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com) book.

I was originally building my own toy language with this book but have stepped back on that decision,
as my language's features were very different from Lox's, making some parts of the book hard to follow.

Instead, I will complete the book with the Lox implementation to internalize the concepts,
and build my own language later with the learnings I acquire.
